          Morris Heights Health Center, a key service for the uninsured, got relatively little support from the Federal PPP program.

          Throughout April a health center in the Northwest Bronx laid off at least 133 employees.

        </p>
        <p class="g-copy">
          The facility, Morris Heights Health Center (MHHC), serves 57,000 patients in Morris Heights and Kingsbridge Heights. The center is known for its outreach to low-income and the uninsured in the neighborhood.

        </p>
        <p class="g-copy">
          Despite that, MHHC received much less than other hospitals in New York, for which the average grant was in the millions. Cuts in staff and funding will likely limit the health center’s functionality in a neighborhood with a high outbreak of
          COVID-19.

        </p>
        <p class="g-copy">
          It’s unclear why MHHC received so little from the Provider Relief Fund, a subsection of the federal CARES Act: a sum of <a href="https://data.covidstimuluswatch.org/individual-record/Morris-Heights-Health-Center">$748,094</a>. Spread across
          its patient load, that amounts to assistance of $13 per patient.
        </p>

        <p class="g-copy">
          Nearby Montefiore Medical Center, meanwhile, received over <a href="https://data.covidstimuluswatch.org/individual-record/Montefiore-Medical-Center">$36 million</a> in grant money from the same program. The Montefiore Hospital network took
          in a total of <a href="https://data.covidstimuluswatch.org/parent/montefiore-medical-center">$482 million</a> across its multiple campuses.

        </p>
        <p class="g-copy">
          The Montefiore system avoided layoffs, according to data from NY Department of Labor. MHCC, meanwhile, was the only healthcare service provider in New York to lay off more than 50 employees, requiring it to register the layoff with state
          labor regulators.

        </p>
        <p class="g-copy">
          Lois Bookhardt-Murray, the hospital’s chief medical officer, says the Health Center is critical in its mission to serve the Bronx, a high need borough.
        </p>
        <p class="g-copy">

          “We’re ranked last in New York when it comes to health outcomes,” she said in an interview with the Bronx Free Press. “There are a lot of factors that contribute to that. We need a different approach if we’re going to change that.”

        </p>
        <p class="g-copy">
          To shore up funds, the center was forced to seek out funds from the Siemens Foundation. The group awarded the health center a <a href="https://www.mhhc.org/News/2020/April/Morris-Heights-Health-Center-to-Receive-150K-fro.aspx">$150,000
            grant </a>to continue operations, which include testing for COVID-19.

        </p>
        <p class="g-copy">
          Bookhardt remarked that the entire borough is short on supplies.
        </p>

        <p class="g-copy">
          “We’d love to test everyone in New York City, but there just aren’t enough testing kits,” remarked Bookhardt-Murray. “We need to use supplies judiciously.”
